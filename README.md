# CardValidator
Card number validator. Enter the card number and you'll see valid it or not.
The basic JS app, that use the angularJs Framework. Created to show my skill in this technology.
My card validator app is used the Luhn algorithm to identify the validity of card. The card must have 16 digits!!!!. 
If card is valid, yoy will see a green frame and a green check mark. If not, you will see a red frame and a red circle.
